## Homework feedback

### Homework 15

Note that you don't need `library(ggplot2)` or `library(dplyr)` if you run `library(tidyverse)` as both are included in tidyverse.

Good job combining comments about what you are doing and why outside of code chunks and how you are doing it inside of code chunks.

### Homework 16

Looks good. On lines 56, 61, 66 etc. you write the code to use the `which()` function to find rows with errors, but I don't see the code that tells you what the levels for these factors are until the end of the code chunk. Did you run `levels()` in the console in order to find out? If so, it would be good to have that code in your .qmd file.

Otherwise looks good.

### Homework 18

Looks good - you might want to do more commenting of the actual code so that you know what e.g. `facet_wrap()` does in a plot.
